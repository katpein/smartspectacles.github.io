			<h2>WHAT CAN OUR PRODUCT DO:</h2>
			<div class="paragraph1">
				<p>We are a group of students who have come together to create a device that is created to make the life of elderly people more pleasant. </br>
				The Smart Spectacles are equipped with a scanner that reads your brain waves, allowing the wearers brain activity to be read.</br>
				The glasses will come with a pocket watch where the interface is displayed in an easy and clear way, so the elderly won't have any trouble understanding it.</br>
				The sensors on the watch will read the brain waves and warn the user if their health is in danger.</br>
				There is also a possibility for the family members of the wearer to be notified of their location, if something happens to be wrong, since navigation is an implemented feature.
				</p>

			<h2>BRAINWAVES AND ELDERLY PEOPLE:</h2>
			<div class="paragraph2">
				<p>ELDERLY ARE MORE FOCUSED THAN YOUNGER PEOPLE, AND KEEP FOCUS EASIER. THEY DEPEND ON FOCUS/ ATTENTION RATHER THAN MEMORY.</br>
				• Older adults had similar performance and hippocampal volumes as younger adults.</br>
				• Task-related theta increases were predictive of memory and unique to younger adults.</br>
				• Task-related alpha decreases were unique to older adults.
				For elderly theta waves are relatively slow (learning and memory).</br>
				Alpha waves are spread throughout the brain, rather than concentrated within the hippocampus.</br>
				However, in spite of these findings, those in the older group performed no worse than those in the younger group when tested on their ability to remember the spatial positioning of the items on the screen. The differences in brainwaves between the two groups may actually reflect a shift towards an alternative cognitive strategy that doesn’t involve relational binding in older adults. [Older people use another method/ cognitive strategy that doesn't need rational binding of elements]
